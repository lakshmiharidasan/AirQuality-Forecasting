## Air Quality Forecasting

## 📌 Project Overview
Air pollution is a significant environmental and public health concern. This project aims to develop a **reliable air quality forecasting system** that predicts pollutant concentration levels such as **PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3** under dynamic and non-linear conditions. The model is designed to provide accurate and timely forecasts, even in cases of noisy or sparse data.

## 🎯 Objectives
- ✅ Develop a robust forecasting model for air quality.
- ✅ Accurately predict pollutant levels over time.
- ✅ Handle dynamic and non-linear environmental changes.
- ✅ Provide actionable insights for public health and environmental safety.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Django,Android-Flutter
- **Machine Learning**:  TensorFlow, Keras
- **Data Handling**: NumPy
- **Database**:  MySQL
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
